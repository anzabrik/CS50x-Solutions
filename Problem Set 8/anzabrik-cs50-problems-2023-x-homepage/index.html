                    <p><em>Hi! My name is Sceptic Hmy, and I'm a biologist, philosopher, and avid hiker.</em></p>
                    <h1>Early life</h1>
                    <p>I was born circa 1780 in the family of I.Y. and H.B., who are accomplished professionals and simply great creatures. Taking to consideration the nature of my parents, I find it difficult to put it into words what they look like and who they are. Suffice it to say, my mom, I.Y., has large and soft ears, much like a koala (although it would be ridiculously inaccurate to describe her as an actual koala).  My dad, H.B., in his turn, has several antennae on his head. They tend to forget the exact number of their kids, let alone their names, which is forgivable, taking into consideration I have over 112 siblings. Some of them are unbelievably nice.</p>
                    <h1>Career</h1>
                    <p>When I meet someone for the first time, they typically assume that my most prominent feature is my <button type="button"
                      onclick="show()" id="go">LEGS</button> (PRESS THE BUTTON to see the pic). Or to be precise, the combination of hen's legs with my thick white fir and tail. Little do they know about the scientific work to which I’ve devoted my whole life. I also don’t know much about it due to the memory issues I’ve been experiencing lately.
                    That's why I keep my Wikipedia page bookmarked and read it every morning. </p>
                    <img src="images/legs.JPG" id="legs" alt="legs" />
                    <script>
                      function show ()
                      {
                        document.getElementById('legs')
                                .style.display = "block";
                      }
                    </script>
                    <h1>Personal life</h1>
                    <p>In addition to superficial relationships with several inherently mundane creatures, I've also maintained mostly fictional on-off relationship with a good-looking being, whom I suspected to be a kind of grasshopper mouse. My heart tends to be free most of the time, though, which isn’t due to its nature but has been rather caused by my circumstances. </p>
